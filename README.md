## üåà Recent work 

* Publication in #Nature Communications (Dec 2022) regarding a large scale consortium effort to develop a #federated learning approach for AI models based on #braincancer#imaging : https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7005624780414480384/
* Publication titled 'Enhancing the REMBRANDT MRI brain cancer collection' in #Nature Scientific Data (Sep 2022)
In this paper, we took raw #MRI scans from the REMBRANDT #braincancer collection, and performed volumetric #segmentation to identify subregions of the brain. #Radiomic features were then extracted to represent the MRIs in a #quantitative yet summarized format.
