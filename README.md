* Publication in *Nature Communications* (**Dec 2022**) regarding a large scale consortium effort to develop a #federated learning approach for AI models based on #braincancer #imaging. [PMID 36470898](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7005624780414480384/)
* Publication titled 'Enhancing the REMBRANDT MRI brain cancer collection' in *Nature Scientific Data* (**Sep 2022**). In this paper, we took raw #MRI scans from the REMBRANDT #braincancer collection, and performed volumetric #segmentation to identify subregions of the brain. #Radiomic features were then extracted to represent the MRIs in a #quantitative yet summarized format.
