Krithika is a Senior Bioinformatician at Georgetown University - Innovation Center for Biomedical Informatics (ICBI). She has over 13 years professional work experience and combines her interdisciplinary skills in bioinformatics and biostatistics for numerous projects. She applies her bioinformatics expertise to develop novel algorithms and analysis pipelines for clinical, genomic and expression profiling data management, quality control and integrative downstream analysis. Her research work also involves utilizing cloud computing for high throughput bioinformatic analysis of genome sequencing data and other omics data, statistical and probabilistic network analysis, systems biology and pathway analysis. 

Krithika is also a core member of the Biomedical informatics shared resources (BISR) at Georgetown University, and has worked with clinical collaborators to perform in-silico analysis on datasets to support and confirm lab findings. In this regard, she has performed computational analysis of gene expression and RNA-seq data from public datasets in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), NCBI dbGAP and other datasets from public repository Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). 

She is also Research Instructor Faculty for the Georgetown University Health Informatics and Data Science (HIDS) Masters program where she runs hands-on workshops teaching genomic data science using R programming. She has also contributed to the development of massive open online course (MOOC) ‚ÄòDemystifying big data in biomedicine ‚Äì a user‚Äôs guide‚Äô for the online education platform edX. Krithika is also part of the leadership team for the Georgetown-HIDS Masters program 

Krithika‚Äôs publications have been cited more than 1290 times in articles published in top-tier journals in the field. It includes a total of 24 publications in international peer reviewed journals. These include 6 first author publications, 4 publications in the Nature publishing group, a book chapter, a review article, and over 40 posters in conferences & symposiums. She is a member of the Bioconductor organizing committee, R-Ladies community, and the Mental Health Informatics Working Group.

* Our paper on `Enhancing the REMBRANDT MRI brain cancer collection` in Nature Scientific Data (Sep 2022)
In this paper, we took raw #MRI scans from the REMBRANDT #braincancer collection, and performed volumetric #segmentation to identify subregions of the brain. #Radiomic features were then extracted to represent the MRIs in a #quantitative yet summarized format.
